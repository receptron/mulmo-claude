// @package-contract
//
// This module is designed to be extractable as a standalone npm
// package (e.g. `@mulmoclaude/chat-service`) at any time. To keep
// that path open, the rules are:
//
//  1. NO raw imports from `../` outside this directory — all host
//     dependencies MUST be passed through `ChatServiceDeps`.
//  2. Types declared here are STRUCTURAL duplicates of what the
//     host app uses. They look like the real `Role` / `Logger` /
//     `StartChatParams` types so the same functions plug in, but
//     they are defined here so the package has no compile-time
//     link back to the host. Importing from a declared package
//     dependency is fine — `Attachment` comes from
//     `@mulmobridge/protocol` (already a runtime dep) rather than
//     being redeclared here (#2488).
//  3. When you add a new dependency, extend `ChatServiceDeps` and
//     thread it through the factory functions — do NOT reach out
//     to a module import. See #269 / #305 for the rationale.
