// Delete a user-authored collection, archiving a full restorable copy
// first. A collection spans three on-disk locations (see
// docs/papers/collections-architecture.md "Deleting a collection"):
//
//   1. data/skills/<slug>/    staging — the canonical skill source
//   2. .claude/skills/<slug>/ active mirror — what discovery scans
//   3. <schema.dataPath>/     the records (one <id>.json per record)
//
// Locations 1 and 2 are a source→mirror pair maintained by the
// skill-bridge hook, but that hook only fires on the agent's own tool
// calls — a server-side delete must remove BOTH explicitly. Before
// anything is removed we write a single skill copy (from the canonical
// staging dir), the records, and an LLM-runnable RESTORE.md to
// `archive/<date>-<uuid>/`.
//
// Only project-scope, non-preset collections are deletable: user-scope
// skills (`~/.claude/skills/`) are read-only from MulmoClaude, and a
// preset (`mc-*`) re-seeds on next boot so deleting it is futile.

This folder is an automatic backup made when the collection was deleted.
Follow these steps to restore it.

1. Recreate the skill files in \`data/skills/${slug}/\` using the **Write
   tool**: read each file under \`skill/\` and Write it to the matching
   path — \`SKILL.md\`, \`schema.json\`, and any \`templates/*\`.

   IMPORTANT — use the Write tool, NOT \`cp\` / \`mv\` / a shell redirect.
   The skill-bridge hook mirrors \`data/skills/${slug}/\` into
   \`.claude/skills/${slug}/\`, and that mirror is what actually registers
   the collection. The hook only fires on Write/Edit tool calls, so a
   \`cp\` would leave the files in staging with no \`.claude/skills/\`
   mirror — the collection would stay invisible. (Writing
   \`.claude/skills/\` directly is not an option either: that path is
   permission-gated.)

3. Confirm the collection reappears at \`/collections/${slug}\`.

- title: ${schema.title}
- dataPath: \`${schema.dataPath ?? recordLocationLabel(schema)}\`
